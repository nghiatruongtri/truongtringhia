| Javascript Array Sum|
| Methods | Pros | Cons |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| reduce() | Concise, expressive, and functional. Can use any logic or operation inside the callback function | Requires
an intial value for the accumulator to avoid errors with empty arrays |
| for-loop | Simple and straightforward. Gives full control over the iteration processs. May have some performance
advantages over other methods | More verbose, error-pronem and less readable than other methods. Requires a counter
variable, a condition, and an increment expression |
| for...of loop | Modern and concise. Does not require a counter variable or an index | Not supported by older
browsers |
| forEach() | Built-in method that executes a callback function for each element of the array | Does not return a value.
Cannot break out of the loop |
| map() and reduce() | Built-in methods that can be chained together to transform and aggregate an array | Creates an
intermediate array that may not be needed |
| Recursion | A technique of calling a function from within itself, until a base case is reached | May cause a stack
overflow error if the array is too large or the base case is not reached |

function measureExecutionTimeAndComplexity(func)  {
    return  function  (...args)  {
        const  start  =  performance.now();  // Start time
        const  result  = func(...args);
        const  end  =  performance.now();  // End time
        const  timeTaken  =  end  -  start;  // Time taken in milliseconds

        console.log(`Function ${func.name} with input ${args} took ${timeTaken.toFixed(4)} ms to execute.`);

        return  result;
    };

}


const  decoratedSumToNA  =  measureExecutionTimeAndComplexity(sum_to_n_a);
const  decoratedSumToNB  =  measureExecutionTimeAndComplexity(sum_to_n_b);
const  decoratedSumToNC  =  measureExecutionTimeAndComplexity(sum_to_n_c);

// Test the decorated functions
console.log(decoratedSumToNA(10000));  // For testing with a larger value to observe execution time
console.log(decoratedSumToNB(10000));
console.log(decoratedSumToNC(10000));
