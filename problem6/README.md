## Scoreboard API Module Specification

### Overview

The Scoreboard API module is designed to manage and update the top 10 user scores on a live scoreboard. This module will

handle incoming requests to update user scores, ensure authentication and authorization of users, and broadcast live

updates to all connected clients.

### Functional Requirements

1. User Authentication and Authorization:


- Authenticate users to ensure they are legitimate.

- Authorize the action to prevent unauthorized score increments.


3. Score Update Endpoint:


- Endpoint to update a user's score when an action is completed.


5. Live Scoreboard Updates:


- Broadcast updated scores to all connected clients in real-time.


7. Top 10 Scores Endpoint:


- Endpoint to retrieve the current top 10 scores.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Security:


- Secure API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access.

- Validate incoming requests to prevent malicious actions.


3. Performance:


- Ensure low latency for real-time updates.

- Efficiently handle high traffic volumes.


5. Scalability:


- Design the module to scale with increasing numbers of users and actions.

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Update Score

- Endpoint: /api/v1/score/update

- Method: POST

- Authentication: Required (Token-based)

- Authorization: Required

- Request Body:

  	{

  	  

  	"user_id": "string",

  	  

  	"score_increment": "integer"

  	  

  	}

Response:

- Success:

  	{

  	  

  	"status": "success",

  	  

  	"message": "Score updated successfully",

  	  

  	"new_score": "integer"

  	  

  	}

- Failure:

  	{

  	  

  	"status": "failure",

  	  

  	"message": "Error message"

  	  

  	}

#### 2. Get Top 10 Scores

- Endpoint: /api/v1/score/top10

- Method: GET

- Authentication: Not Required

- Response:

  	{


  	
  	"status": "success",

  	  

  	"top_scores": [

  	  

  	{"user_id": "string", "score": "integer"},



  	...



  	]



  	}

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Authentication and Authorization

- Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication.

- Validate JWT tokens in the middleware before processing requests.

#### 2. Database Schema

- Users Table:

  		CREATE TABLE users (

  		  

  		user_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,

  		  

  		username VARCHAR,

  		  

  		password_hash VARCHAR,

  		  

  		score INT DEFAULT 0



  	);

- Scores Table:

CREATE TABLE scores (

score_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

user_id VARCHAR REFERENCES users(user_id),

score INT,

created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

);

#### 3. Live Updates

- Use WebSockets to broadcast score updates to all connected clients.

- Integrate with a WebSocket library (e.g., Socket.IO) on both the server and client sides.

# Scoreboard API Module

## Overview

This module manages the top 10 user scores and provides real-time updates. It handles score updates, user

authentication, and broadcasts live updates.

## API Endpoints

### Update Score

- **URL:**  `/api/v1/score/update`


- **Method:** POST


- **Description:** Updates the score for a user.


- **Request Body:**

```json

  

{

  

"user_id": "string",

  

"score_increment": "integer"

  

}

```

## Additional Comments

- Ensure the database is backed up regularly to prevent data loss.


- Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of the score update endpoint.


- Regularly audit and update security measures to protect against new vulnerabilities.

### Comments for Improvement

- Security: Implement additional security measures such as rate limiting and IP blocking to prevent abuse of the API.


- Scalability: Consider using a message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ) to handle high volumes of score update requests.


- Testing: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the module functions correctly under various
  scenarios.


- Documentation: Provide detailed documentation for setting up and running the WebSocket server, including client-side
  integration examples.


- Monitoring: Implement monitoring and logging to track API usage and performance metrics, enabling proactive
  maintenance and scaling.
